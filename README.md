# Smartness Test

This is my smartness test.

## Installing and Uninstalling

 To install it, `cd` into the directory you want to install it into and run the following command:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WinparWinpar/SmartnessTest/main/Test-dl.sh; which java > /dev/null || bash Test-dl.sh -i; which brew > /dev/null || bash Test-dl.sh -i
```

To uninstall it, `cd` into the directory containing the `Test-dl.sh` file and run the following command:
```
bash Test-dl.sh -u
```
